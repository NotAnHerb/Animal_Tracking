# Animal_Tracking
The goal of this project is to write code to track a rodent in real time (30 fps) with a high level of accuracy. Ideally, the code will identify 1) where the animal is 2) in what direction it is facing 3) how fast it is moving 4) SMP values 5) location of head/nose 6) body elongation.
